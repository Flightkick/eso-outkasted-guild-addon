ESO has reserved filenames for files with the `_?(en|de|fr|ru).lua` pattern. Only the file for the current language is loaded.  

To quickly switch client language, use `/script SetCVar("language.2", "fr")` obviously with the correct language code.

This Add-On only contains translations for public facing text. Internal debugging is always in English.
